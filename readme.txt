YITH WooCommerce Wishlist add all Wishlist features to your website. Needs WooCommerce to work.
WooCommerce 10.2.x compatible.

== Description ==

The wishlist is one of the most powerful and popular tools in an ecommerce shop. Thanks to the wishlist, users can:

* Save their favourite products, find them quickly and easily at a later time and buy them.
* Share the wishlist with relatives and friends for Christmas, birthdays and similar occasions so they can buy them one of the products from the list.
* Share the wishlist on social networks and get indirect advertising for your store.

This means that you’ll be able to loyalise customers, push them to buy and attract new customers any time a wishlist is shared. Not bad for one plugin only, don’t you think?

Our YITH WooCommerce Wishlist has more than **900,000 active installations** and that’s why it’s **the most popular wishlist plugin ever.**

To celebrate this record and say thanks to all the plugin users, we’ve decided to release a new 3.0 version that has improved the design tremendously  and added many new options.

**If you like the new design, please, leave a review to help the plugin grow!**

== Installation ==

1. Unzip the downloaded zip file.
2. Upload the plugin folder into the `wp-content/plugins/` directory of your WordPress site.
3. Activate `YITH WooCommerce Wishlist` from Plugins page

YITH WooCommerce Wishlist will add a new submenu called "Wishlist" under "YITH Plugins" menu. Here you are able to configure all the plugin settings.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does YITH WooCommerce Wishlist allows adding an “add to wishlist” button on the products on shop page and archive pages? =
Yes, from version 3.0 the plugin also allows showing the Add to wishlist button on your **shop page, category pages, product shortcodes, product sliders,** and all the other places where the WooCommerce products’ loop is used.

= Can I customize the wishlist page? =
Yes, the page is a simple template and you can override it by putting the file template "wishlist.php" inside the "woocommerce" folder of the theme folder.

= Can I move the position of "Add to wishlist" button? =
Yes, you can move the button to another default position or you can also use the shortcode inside your theme code.

= Can I change the style of "Add to wishlist" button? =
Yes, you can change the colors of background, text and border or apply a custom css. You can also use a link or a button for the "Add to wishlist" feature.

= Wishlist page returns a 404 error? =
Try to regenerate permalinks from Settings -> Permalinks by simply saving them again.

= Have you encountered anomalies after plugin update, that did not exist in the previous version? =
This might depend on the fact that your theme overrides plugin templates. Check if the developer of your theme has released a compatibility update with version 3.0 or later of YITH WooCommerce Wishlist. As an alternative you can try the plugin in WordPress default theme to leave out any possible influences by the theme.

= I am currently using Wishlist plugin with Catalog Mode enabled in my site. Prices for products should disappear, yet they still appear in the wishlist page. Can I remove them? =
Yes, of course you can. To avoid Wishlist page to show product prices, you can hide price column from wishlist table. Go to YITH -> Wishlist -> Wishlist Page Options and disable option "Product price".

= How can I report security bugs? =
You can report security bugs through the Patchstack Vulnerability Disclosure Program. The Patchstack team help validate, triage and handle any security vulnerabilities. [Report a security vulnerability.](https://patchstack.com/database/vdp/yith-woocommerce-wishlist)
